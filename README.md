3) We can delete todo if we do not want to include them or created by mistake by using the delete button.
4) We can also mark them complete or Incomplete using the check box simply click on the box if the todo is complete and it will show Completed !
5) We can edit our todo's if we need to elaborate our todos or simply correct some typos in the name of the todos click the hand edit icon and
   then save the todo again after correction.
